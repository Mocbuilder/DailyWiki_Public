# DailyWiki
This is the Github page for my DailyWiki project, if you run it, it will get a Wikipedia article trough Wikimedia API, 
and display it on a ASP.Net Core Web Application. 
The website has a working Log of all articles that were displayed, atleast as long as the program is running.
If the program is no longer working, please contact me: mocbuildercc@gmail.com

# How to run
Right now its only a Visual Studio (2022 Preview) Project, so you need to pen it there to run it.
